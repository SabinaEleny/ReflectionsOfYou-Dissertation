# Reflections of You

> A 2D interactive game developed in Unity as an assessment tool for identifying masking behaviors in high-functioning autism.

## üåü About The Project

This project was created as part of a university dissertation and born from a passion to blend technology with psychology. **Reflections of You** is a 2D narrative game that serves as a high-functioning autism assessment tool, with a specific focus on identifying **masking behaviors** in teens and young adults.

As a solo developer, I was responsible for every facet of its creation‚Äîfrom the C# programming and narrative design to the custom visual art and character development. The core of the game lies in its branching dialogue paths and immersive social scenarios, which are designed to gently and accurately highlight the nuanced signs of masking.

To ensure the game's clinical relevance and impact, its development was informed by close collaboration with **psychologists and autism centers**, whose expert feedback was instrumental in shaping the final experience.
